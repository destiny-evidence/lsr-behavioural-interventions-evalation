"""Pydantic data models for behavioural-intervention (household energy) extraction.

The models mirror the hierarchy of the codebook:

        DeliveryDetails              only for Information / Feedback / Social Comparison arms

        MotivationDetails            only for Motivation arms
      Effect_Stub                    one per reported estimate (where / which arms / which kind)
      Effect                         stub + the estimate block selected by the stub

Sub-models that are only queried when a higher level calls for them are held as
Optional: ``None`` means "not applicable / not queried", while the string "NR"
means "queried but not reported in the paper".
